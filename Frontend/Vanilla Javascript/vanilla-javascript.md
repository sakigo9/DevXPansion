| **Call Stack**      | Learn how JavaScript executes functions using the call stack, a LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure.                             |
| **Event Loop**      | Understand how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations and non-blocking I/O via the event loop.                               |
| **Task Queue**      | Learn about the task queue where asynchronous callbacks are queued and how they are processed.                                   |
| **Microtask Queue** | Explore the microtask queue which processes promises and mutation observers before the task queue.                               |
| **Execution Order** | Understand how the call stack, event loop, task queue, and microtask queue work together to manage execution flow in JavaScript. |
